		<description><![CDATA[Lessons learned from this experience:
1) A skilled pilot really helps.  Flying along a coastline is a skill many pilots do not have, so it is worthwhile to ask.
2) Conditions are crucial: we couldn&#039;t fly higher than about 1000 ft. because of haze, therefore our swath size was very limited.  Flying at a lower altitude, it was harder to capture the coastline.
3) Test your rig on the ground, especially the attachment to the airplane.  Cessna 172 or similar work well.

Regarding #1 above: Our pilot had over 50 years of flying experience and no on board navigation systems.  He literally took out a large paper map of the area right after takeoff (I wish I was kidding).  As you can imagine, this limited us.]]></description>
