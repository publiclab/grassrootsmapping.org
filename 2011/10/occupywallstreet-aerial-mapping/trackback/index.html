<p><em>Post written by Oscar Brett</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Arriving  at Zucotti Park in downtown Manhattan, the site of #Occupy#Wallstreet,  you can feel the energy of the crowd. The level of diversity  (ideological/ ethnic/ generational) is unbelievable. The Occupation of  Wall Street began on September 17th and it is getting stronger each day.  I see my involvement in the park as that of a community builder and  artist. The maintenance of a community at Zucotti park is an incredibly  important thing; no matter how disparate the media claims the thousands  of occupiers to be, there is one thing for certain &#8212; they are a  community made up of individual people, with varying goals and  intentions, voicing their dissent for the systemic problems of the  world. Political, ethical, legal, societal, economic qualms are all  being voiced in this space, but a major issue exists: how do you bring  the animal rights expert together with the Marxist economist, the LGBT  advocate together with the anarchist; how can so many ideologies gel?</p>
<p dir="ltr">My role has been to try and unite people through communal exercise  which takes the form of public (or community) based art&#8211; this was  exactly the purpose of using community involvement to build, and fly, a  weather balloon rig and map an #Occupy#Wallstreet march on October 5th.</p>
<p>This project would have been impossible without the help of Leif  Percifield and Liz Barry. On the night of October 4th, I met with them  and they supplied me with all the equipment I needed: line (2x 40lb of  250ft and 1 100lb of 250ft), a 4GB sd card, and a supply of tape. The SD  card was loaded with a script that enables a Cannon Powershot to shoot  continuously without having to hold down the shutter button.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1011" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/camera-rig2/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1011" title="camera rig2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera-rig2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera-rig2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera-rig2.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Later that night I took a 2am train to the Lower East Side to purchase a  Cannon Powershot A495 (a lightweight point and shoot which is great for  flying) that Leif located on Craigslist. By 4am the camera casing was  built and the camera was ready for shooting the next morning. The actual  construction of the rig would occur at Zucotti park the following  morning.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the park the next day I linked up with the  #Occupy#Wallstreet media working group and began preparation for the  flight. The media working group funded the balloons and helium; 100  12inch rainbow party balloons were purchased (pre filled) from Balloon  Saloon on West Broadway and Duane, costing $125. The balloons arrived at  the park at around 2pm, one hour prior to the march. I preemptively cut  10 lines of 10ft cotton chord to be used in the rigs construction. I  attempted to get as many people involved in as many elements of the  construction as possible; I hollered at people in the park to hold this,  cut that, or wind these. People were very excited to take part in any  form of constructive action.</p>
<p>The construction of the actual weather balloon rig engaged between 50  and 75 occupiers. The police have vetoed our right to use forms of voice  amplification, which has spurred an ingenious and highly democratic  approach to addressing a crowd. A metaphysical  device called the “peoples’ mic” was created. The addressor yells “Mic  check!” and everyone who can hear her/him responds by echoing “mic  check”, the addressor then speaks in short sentences and allows for the  chorus of people closest to them to echo what they are saying. It is in  this way that the message is passed through a large crowd [each message  often has upwards of 3 echos from the first people who hear it to those  on the periphery of the crowd]. I utilized the “peoples mic” to address  those who were constructing the rig.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1012" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/balloons2/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012" title="balloons2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/balloons2.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">I addressed the crowd and asked 10 people to pick up the ends of the  ten strings; an additional person then secured each of the ten strings  to a key ring. This produced a circular decapus (think octopus)  structure of cotton line about twenty feet in diameter. I then held a  small lesson on tying very basic slip knots and instructed folks to tie  ten slip knots on each line (aprox. 1 foot apart from each other). This  task of tying 100 slip knots only took about 10 minutes because there  were at least 25 to 30 additional participants tying them. Even more  people cued up in front of the two massive bags of inflated balloons to  pick up one balloon at a time, insert the balloon ties into the  prefabricated slip knots, and tighten them. I was amazed at the fact  that not one balloon popped or flew away during this operation. The free  ends of ten balloon strings were then secured to an additional key ring  and let go to rise into the air. This produced in theory a balloon  globe; however, in practice it resembled more of a bundle. People were  very excited to be taking part in such a communal event. There was  constant giddy dialogue between the participants, exchanges of numbers  and contact information, and a general good vibe.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1013" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/person-with-balloons2/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013" title="person with balloons2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/person-with-balloons2.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="360" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/person-with-balloons2.jpg 242w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/person-with-balloons2-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Balloon bundle was attached to a fishing clip, via its bottom key  ring and the two 40lb lines and the 100lb line was attached to the clip.  The decision to use three lines to control the rig was made for two  reasons. First we felt it would be easier to control the rig in the  narrow space between skyscrapers with three points (a triangle) on the  ground; and second, we were not sure how police would respond so we  wanted to ensure the return of the images even if one of us was  handcuffed/ tackled by the police [the plan was for the remaining two pilots to pull the rig in immediately and secure the SD card if the third one was immobilized by police].</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1016" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/showing-how-to-use-balloons2/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1016" title="showing how to use balloons2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/showing-how-to-use-balloons2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/showing-how-to-use-balloons2-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/showing-how-to-use-balloons2.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The process of mapping began at the north east corner of Zuccotti park  just as the march began; It had been previously disclosed to me that the  march would attempt to cross the Brooklyn bridge so the 15 block walk  from Zuccotti seemed not to daunting a distance. Myself and two other  members of the protest controlled the reels, there were probably five  other marchers who constantly stayed with us either documenting, aiding  in communication between us three controlling the rig, or reeling in  excess line at moments when time was of the essence.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1018" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/protest-track-2/"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1019" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/protest-track-3/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1019" title="protest track" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protest-track2-300x162.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="162" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protest-track2-300x162.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protest-track2.jpg 698w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">We made it about two blocks up Broadway successfully, before our first  snag occurred. Upon hitting a cross street a gust of wind blew  one of the lines into the crux of a lamp pole. Our solution was to fly  the balloon close enough to the lamp pole (using the other two balloons)  to slacken the stuck string. This same problem occurred at least three  more times, and one of the times we had to cut and reattach one of the  three lines.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1014" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/protestors-and-balloons2/"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1015" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/person-with-balloons2-2/"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1022" href="/2011/10/occupywallstreet-aerial-mapping/protestors-and-balloons2-2/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1022" title="protestors and balloons2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protestors-and-balloons21-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protestors-and-balloons21-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protestors-and-balloons21-682x1024.jpg 682w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/10/protestors-and-balloons21.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><br />
</a></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Our plan was to start at the front of the procession and walk slowly so  as to allow for the entire procession to pass us by the end of the  march. By starting at the front and ending at the back we believed we  would produce both a map of the physical route taken by the processors  as well as allow for the full documentation of all marching bodies in  space. In practice this was made difficult by multiple factors; the  corralling of people by the police inhibited us from moving freely  between both sidewalks and the street, the unpredictable nature of the  crowd speed, as well as issues of tangling lines. We took the balloon  down and put it up pretty frequently, at one point there were low  hanging trees at another there was scaffolding; needless to say we  didn’t photography the walk in its entirety. Among the best imagery we  gathered was the walk from Printing House Square to half way down the  Brooklyn bridge as well as the police barricade on the Brooklyn side of  the bridge. We also gathered some pretty good shots on the walk up  Broadway from Zuccotti park.</p>
<p>This  map was made using Mapknitter, an open source program that allows  for  direct manipulation of photographed images over a satellite  backdrop, I  used a google map backdrop.
